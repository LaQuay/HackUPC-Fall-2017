### What it does
**Lazarus**, a mobile application for Android that helps blind or visually impaired people to move around the city and perform simple tasks of daily life without the face-to-face help of a caregiver, family member or friend using only basic tools such as geolocation, voice recognition or the camera.

Lazarus has two types of users:

**Blind users**: people who need help in situations of confusion (like getting lost in a public space) or emergency (read a warning text, for example).

**Helper users**: volunteers willing to "lend" their eyes to those who can not see. Its function is to answer the questions of blind people by transcribing texts or describing images.

### What can the app do for blind people?
Lazarus has 5 basic options that can be used manually or with simple voice instructions.

**1. Location**: A lost user can instantly know where he is thanks to simplified maps, specially designed for people with visual disabilities, and GPS.

**2. Close to me**: This option indicates relevant spaces that are around the user in an area of 500 meters as: pharmacies, banks, post offices, supermarkets or coffee shops.

**3. Look for me**: This option allows the user to ask other people what is happening around him eg in situations of confusion or danger (knowing if a food is in a good condition or some pills without a box are the ones he have to take). The user only has to take a photograph and thanks to the help of volunteer users, will solve his doubts.

**4. Read text:** Lazarus automatically translates written texts into voice messages through an OCR process.

**5. Describe object**: Lazarus can recognize objects from the real-world in order to help you with your daily issues.
